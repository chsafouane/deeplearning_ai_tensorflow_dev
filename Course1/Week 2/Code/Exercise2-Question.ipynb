    "Some notes:\n",
    "1. It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs= to 10, but nothing larger\n",
    "2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n",
    "3. If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class\n",
